look at the site https://www.washthehome.com/ - on the top there is an instant quote system. study it. it takes the user through 2 steps, and then shows a HTML and pdf of the quote. try to recreate the 2 steps interface in an app. use Vue / React and Tailwind CSS. break the steps into components - step 1 is one component, step 2 is another component and questions of step 3 are a few components in which the exact question is sent by the server. All components send api request to the same server endpoint when they are submitted.
